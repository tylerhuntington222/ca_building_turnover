# NOTES:

MASTER TODO LIST:

- Comment all functions!
- clean up logical statements that span multiple lines
- remove spaces around = signs in all function calls
- adjust RebuildMultiplied() to use stock.year, sim.year convention
- change AssignAgroup() to use correct yr field -DONE
- make subtypes.df$Typef character class -DONE
- check with Hanna about ConvertLot() and whether this can accept spillover from other subtypes within a parent type -DONE 
  - currenty configured to do so. -DONE
- integrate btl ratio handling in case that st level btl not found in main control flow of sims -DONE

- slot in GetCountyMultiplier function for determining g.mult.20 - DONE

- fix indentations

- turn control flow that handles a single county within %dopar% of master into a function that is sourced in a new master script

- ask Hanna about handling parcels with NA BArea (fx.32)

# - in the ConvertLot20 function, does this handle ranking within the
# Condo/MF case properly? -DONE

# - question about formatting of tabular data in 2020Rebuild sheet of output -DONE

# - question about Deactivated2020 sheet of output df
# - if fs diff is negative should vacated building statuses be changed to
# deactivated or vacant? -DONE

# -791 - should lotarea (and BArea) fields be changes with conversions?-DONE

# -when assigning EUI vintages, how should 2020 building be assigned?
# - is there supposed to be a condition for these in the EUIVint tab? -DONE

# three letter county codes? -DONE

# statewide btl ratios table? -DONE -see tab in sample output

# 2016 College building stock numbers are inconsistent between
model output and your sample spreadsheet

# PUD usetype in summary tables? -DONE -exclude from summary tables

7.11.16 - Meeting with Hanna

- decided to eliminate the square footage diference threshold for usetypes to ignore - DONE

- decided to iterate over subtypes for applying growth multipliers and
calculating/filling floorspace differences. -DONE

- decided to have two output table files, one with summaries broken down by
type and one with summaries broken down by usetype
- decided to use 2016 BtoL ratios throughout future simulations for determining
how much open/vacant lot area can be taken up by new builds.

- data cleaning steps should be done outside of main script
  - should these changes be hard-coded in data files
  - or, performed in a separate, clean.R script which acts as a bridge from the
  raw data files to the master analysis script?

- need to add total energy use fields to shapefile
  - calculate by multiplying building area for particular year by EUI
  multiplier

7.12.17

Steps for formatting output tables by subtype:

  - in WriteOutput(), merge county's subtype summary stats to a template
  which contains rows for all possible subtypes, with .drop = F
  - change WriteOutput function to output an RDS file to  ../output_data/temp
  for a particular county. This will be a list, each element corresponding to
  an item to be written to a particular sheet in the eventual output table

  - after parallel processing of all counties finished:
    - read in RDS summary stats files for each county
    - initialize the output xlsx file with column names for all subtypes

  - after calculating summary stats for a county, mer

Change Log:
  - replaced all "NewArea" refs with "BArea.20"
  - replaced all "FNArea.50" refs with "BArea.50"
  - in FillVacant() added stock.year, sim.year params
    - need to change calls in master -DONE
  - in ConvertLot() changed params to elim year and add stock.year, sim.year
    - need to change calls in master -DONE

  - reduced small difference thresh to 10k
  - added handling for industrial types so that vacant lots are not allocated to them

IN MOTION:
  - in ST version of master script, reformatting so that all summaries are written at end
    - PENDING- retrieve county output data and write to wb for each county

  - added two params to MakeRow(): grouping and template.df
    - need to change calls in master -DONE

  - changing TYPE/Typef refs throughout control flow of sims
    - need to go thru functions and do the same
